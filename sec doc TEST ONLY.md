# Title
New Procedure for Adding Online Student Experience of Courses Survey Module to Moodle

## Description
This procedure was updated after consultation with the Office of the Provost and Vice President, Academic and Research, 
in order to better algin with Policy 5310,i.e. so that student survey responses would not be available to instructors until after
the submission of grades, as is the case with the paper version of the survey.

## Steps
- After receiving a request to add the survey from an instructor, go to Course reuse, under More, in the relevant course.
- Search for student experience of courses, select the SEC course, and continue.
- Click Next at the bottom of page, ensure that only the Student Experience Survey (and its section)are checked, and click Next.
- Click Perform import at bottom of page, and click Continue.
- Send the following message to the instructor, after updating it with the correct dates (e.g. Winter 2025, May 19th, and May 31st) for the current term:

Hello,

I've added the survey module to the end of the General section in your course. The survey is currently hidden from students, and you can make it 
visible whenever you are ready. 
 
Also, here is a resource related to the survey [Student Experience of Courses Survey NEW.pdf](https://moodle.mta.ca/pluginfile.php/40942/mod_resource/content/7/Student%20Experience%20of%20Courses%20Survey%20NEW.pdf?redirect=1)
 
**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You will only be able to view/download survey results during the “release period”, after the deadline for submitting grades.
For Winter 2025 the release period will be from May 19th to May 31st.  If you wish to access the results after the end of the release period,
you must download the results BEFORE the end of the release period, as the results data will be permanently deleted at that time.
This procedure has been implemented in order to align with [Senate Policy 5310 - Policy on Surveys of the Student Experience of Courses](https://mta.ca/about/leadership-and-governance/policies-and-procedures/policy-5310-policy-surveys-student-experience-courses),
which governs the survey. 

Please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns! 

## Potential issues/pitfalls
- be sure to only import the survey from the SEC (shortname) course, as that is the version of the version of the survey with the tracking tag, which
allows the Educational Technology Consultant to later find/update/delete the online surveys.
- you must have professor permissions in the SEC course to perform the import (if required, ask the Educational Technology Consultant to add you as 
Professor_Manual).
