How to Create a Markdown Document in Windows 11 Notepad

## Description
There are several ways to create a markdown document, including writing with proper markdown syntax in Notepad, and using a dedicated markdown editor. It can also be done using the new Rich Text Formatting in Windows 11 Notepad; this method is outlined below.

## Steps
- Open the Notepad desktop app.
- Type some text that you wish to format and select it, or place you cursor where you wish to add formatted test.
- Select a format option from the new toolbar located to the right of the View menu at the top of your document.
- When you are finished editing, select Save as Markdown file after clicking the Save as option under the File menu.

## Potential issues/pitfalls
- You may want to check your work in a separate app to ensure that the markdown output displays as expected, by uploading your file to a GitHub repository and opening it from there, for example.
