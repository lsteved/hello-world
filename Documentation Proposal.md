**Documentation Management Proposal**



* **create** documentation as markdown documents
* **store** these documents in CSD Operations > General > Files > Documentation in Markdown Format
* in Samanage, **paste** the content of each document into a stand-alone Solution or a Solution RELATED to specific ticket; and, **add** the document itself as an attachment to the applicable Solution, for reference



A few notes

* pasting the content of the documents into Solutions allows for quick access of information, and also may be helpful for Samanage search/AI suggestions, i.e. content of attachments may not be found as easily?
* Copilot Analyst and Researcher (or SharePoint equivalents?) could potentially be used to retrieve information from the Documentation in Markdown Format folder above
* one reason for having the primary document storage in Teams/SharePoint instead of Samanage is that Samanage requires an API request to download all the attachments (i.e. the documentation documents attached to Samanage Solutions)
* there is an apparently unused Subcategory in Samanage (CSD Internal > Administrative Duties) where we could possilby file all our documentation Solutions in one location, if helpful
