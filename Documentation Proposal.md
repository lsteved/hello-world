**Documentation Management Proposal**



* **CREATE** documentation as markdown documents
* in Teams, **STORE** these documents in CSD Operations > General > Files > Documentation in Markdown Format
* in Samanage, **PASTE** the content of each document into a stand-alone Solution or a Solution RELATED to specific ticket; and, **ADD** the document itself as an attachment to the applicable Solution, for reference
* perhaps also add a CSD Operations documentation **TAG** to the Solution



A few notes

* Teams(SharePoint) is suggested as the primary documentation storage location due to its convenient interface (e.g. no API request required to download all attached documents, as with Samanage), whereas the documentation content is also added to Samanage to facilitate efficient day-to-day support work
* with storage in Teams, Copilot Chat or an Agent (using the Documentation in Markdown Format folder above as its knowledge source) could be used to retrieve information from the documentation
* Copilot Analyst and Researcher could also be used, for more in-depth information requests
* pasting the content of the documents into Solutions, instead of only adding them as attachments, allows for easier viewing of information, and also may be helpful for Samanage search/AI suggestions, i.e. content of attachments may not be searched as easily?
* this documentation management approach would involve minimal setup and not require the addition of any new platforms or software (i.e. Analyst and Researcher are already enabled in Copilot, and an Agent like the one mentioned above can be created quite easily)
