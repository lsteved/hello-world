**Documentation Management Proposal**



* **CREATE** documentation as markdown documents
* **STORE** these documents in CSD Operations > General > Files > Documentation in Markdown Format
* in Samanage, **PASTE** the content of each document into a stand-alone Solution or a Solution RELATED to specific ticket; and, **ADD** the document itself as an attachment to the applicable Solution, for reference
* perhaps also add a CSD Operations documentation **TAG** to the Solution



A few notes

* pasting the content of the documents into Solutions allows for quick access of information, and also may be helpful for Samanage search/AI suggestions, i.e. content of attachments may not be found as easily?
* Copilot Chat or an Agent (using the Documentation in Markdown Format folder above as its knowledge source) could be used to retrieve information from the documentation
* Copilot Analyst and Researcher could be used for more in-depth information requests 
* one reason for having the primary document storage in Teams/SharePoint instead of Samanage is that Samanage requires an API request to download all the attachments (i.e. the documentation documents attached to Samanage Solutions)
* this documentation management approach would involve minimal setup and not require the addition of any new platforms or software (i.e. Analyst and Researcher are already enabled in Copilot, and an Agent like the one mentioned above can be created in a couple minutes)
