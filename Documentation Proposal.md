Documentation Proposal



* **create** documentation as markdown documents
* **store** these documents in CSD Operations > General > Files > Documentation in Markdown Format
* in Samanage, **paste** the content of each document into a stand-alone Solution or a Solution RELATED to specific ticket; and, **add** the document itself as an attachment to the applicable Solution, for reference



Note: pasting the content of the documents into Solutions allows for quick access, and also may be helpful for Samanage search/AI suggestions, i.e. content of attachments may not be found as easily?
