# Title
New SEC (Student Experience of Courses) Survey Procedure

## Description
Change to procedure, as of March 2025.

Until March 2025 faculty had the ability to view the responses of online surveys as soon as they were submitted by students (unlike with paper versions of the survey). Apparently, this should not have been the case.

In order to only have the responses available at a certain date (i.e. after the grades submission deadline each term) I changed the permissions on the Survey Feedback module in the SEC course so that the results would not be available until I updated the permissions at the start of the “release period”. (I also removed the ability of Professors to Backup activities for the Survey Feedback Activity/module, though they can still back it up as part of a full course backup. And, I Locked “Include permission overrides” in the General restore defaults and in the General import defaults Moodle Admin settings.) I also added a tag to the Survey Feedback module to make it easier to find the courses into which it had been imported each term (either by me, Tracey, Denise or Amanda). 

## Steps
- Step 1:
SO... UPON REQUEST, import the Student Experience of Courses module into the required course(s) and send the following message to the instructor (after updating the dates to the relevant term): 

 
I've added the survey module to the end of the General section in your course. The survey is currently hidden from students, and you can make it visible whenever you are ready. 

Also, here is a resource related to the survey [Student Experience of Courses Survey NEW.pdf](https://moodle.mta.ca/pluginfile.php/40942/mod_resource/content/7/Student%20Experience%20of%20Courses%20Survey%20NEW.pdf?redirect=1)   

IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only be able to view/download survey results during the “release period”, after the deadline for submitting grades. For Winter 2025 the release period will be from May 19th to May 31st.  If you wish to access the results after the end of the release period, you must download the results BEFORE the end of the release period, as the results data will be permanently deleted at that time. This procedure has been implemented in order to align with [Senate Policy 5310 - Policy on Surveys of the Student Experience of Courses](https://mta.ca/about/leadership-and-governance/policies-and-procedures/policy-5310-policy-surveys-student-experience-courses), which governs the survey. 

Please, don't hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions or concerns! 

- Step 2:
THEN... on May 19th (or applicable date for that term), go to [Tags | Mount Allison University Online Learning](https://moodle.mta.ca/tag/search.php) and search for the appropriate tag (e.g. will be sec25ss, sec25fa, sec26wi, etc. going forward), then click on the tag, which will bring up a list of courses. Go into each course for the applicable term, and change the permissions for the Student Experience of Courses activity in 2 places, under Activity: Feedback... 1. View reports, 2. View the analysis page after submit (1. should already cover this, but just to be safe), and move Professor from Prohibited to Roles with permission, using the trash can/plus sign. Email the instructors that the results are now available AND remind them that the data will be deleted/that they need to save the Excel/csv file if they wish to keep data. 

- Step 3:
THEN... on May 31st (or applicable date for that term), go back in and remove the permissions you added on May 19th for each course. And (this is according to the policy governing the survey), delete the survey data, i.e. delete the module from each course. Note: simply deleting the survey will also accomplish the "remove the permissions you added" step.

## Potential issues/pitfalls
- Potential issue 1:
Future release period dates are tentatively as follows (hopefully to be confirmed by Richard Isnor shorty after the time of this writing, October 29, 2025).


Future Winter Term Release Periods: the 2 weeks leading into May 31st of that calendar year,
Future Spring/Summer Term Release Periods: the 2 weeks leading into September 30th of that calendar year,
Future Fall Term Release Periods: the 2 weeks leading into January 31st of the following calendar year

- Potential issue 2:
As also noted in the Description... I removed the ability of Professors to Backup activities for the Survey Feedback Activity/module, though they can still back it up as part of a full course backup
